Reflections for Lesson 2

What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
Initializing a repository will create a .git "folder", you need to do it in order to create commits or a place where you can
access the commits.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
It is a stage before the repository, you can choose to which files be included in a single commit

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
Using the staging area, we can compare between two files in both staging area and working space and commit and staging area

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?
Branches are useful if you want to add new features but still want to have a running version
