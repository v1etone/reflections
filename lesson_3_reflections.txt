When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
If i want to work with other people and share the work.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
If many people contribute to a file, things could become quite messy. Having an overview and knowing when to pull which kind of changes is a way to 
keep structure in your file.
